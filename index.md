At first glance, you may mistake a Bombay cat for a miniature panther. In fact, that is why the breed was created by Louisville, KY breeder Nikki Horner, who set her sights on producing a copper-eyed, black shorthaired cat with the exotic appearance of a mini or “parlor” panther. The black leopard of India inspired her choice of the breed’s name.

Cookies A.K.A Panther or Panties to those close to him, is a very lively Bombay cat, playful and affectionate, he loves people and is adaptable to many different environments and lifestyles. He prefers to stay indoors so letting him out is a big no-no! 

He was neutered when he was 4 months old and he loves his litter box super clean as he is very particular with his hygiene. He eats mainly dry food but he won't say no to some wet food from time to time!

Plus, if you want a dog, a cat or a monkey all rolled into one mischievious package, Cookies is definitely the man!
